                <h4 class="post-date">05/14/23</h4>
                <p class="post-text">
                    If you think about it, the hobby of birdwatching is pretty strange.
                    I mean you're trying to tell me that you just walk to the park to sit there and look at birds?
                    There are much more fascinating animals such as the squirrels which commonly roam urban and suburban areas and are subjectively much cuter.</p>

            <h4 class="post-date">07/03/23</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                Cream cheese, the common everyday consumer kind, is a scam.
                There, I said it.
                Why? Becasue it's full of heavily processed dairy that is mixed in with chemical substitutes that is horrific for your body and not because I wasted $34 off a creeam cheese reseller.

                People will believe it.
                Why not?
                You can post anonymously on the internet and no one can find out who you are except expert level hackers.
                With basic manipulation, you can trick people into voting against their own self interest.
                Eventually, the misinformation you spread will create echo chambers online, exponentionally increasing the power of your lie.
                Soon, nobody will know the truth.
                Not even you.

            <h4 class="post-date">09/25/23</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models have recently garnered attention for reaching mildly warm tempuratures as 116 degrees fahrenheit, or 46.7 degrees for those of us who don't believe in freedom.
                While benchmarks, AAA video games, and stress tests only cause temperatures of 103 degrees F (39.4 C) this apparantly is an unsolvable problem with Apple's latest chipset.
